    <h1>Blog Post 1</h1>
    <p>
      This week I figured I would take a look through the MDN documentation to
      find some tags that I was unfamiliar with. <br />
      The first tag I came across that I was unfamiliar with was the
      &lt;code&gt; element. It is a cool a useful tag for denoting what is code.
      <br />
      It is something that seems like it would be very useful for a website that
      is intended to teach people how to program, through giving them example
      code. <br />
      <br />
      The following is an example of how the &lt;code&gt; element can be used.
      More information about it can be found
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code"
        target="_blank"
        >HERE</a
      >
    </p>
    <code
      >public static void main (String[] args) { <br />System.out.println("Hello
      World!") <br />
      }
    </code>

    <p>
      Another interesting HTML element I learned this week is the
      &lt;details&gt; tag. <br />
      It seems like it would be a very useful tag for when a developer has a lot
      of topics of information that can be expanded on, but would otherwise take
      up too much room. <br />
      For example, if I had a bunch of different breeds of cats with information
      about each one rather than have all of it presented at once I could hide
      it until a user wants to open a specific cats information. <br />
      There are many other examples of how this could be applied, such as types
      of cars, or really anything that have a lot of different types and
      information. <br />
      <br />
      Here is an example of how this could be done. More information can be
      found
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details"
        target="_blank"
        >HERE</a
      >
      about the &lt;details&gt; tag.
