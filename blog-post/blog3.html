      <h1>Cool text underline on hover feature</h1>
      <p>
        This week I wanted to learn how I could better style my website. I
        stumbled across a cool feature that allows for underlining of text when
        its hovered. <br />
        This has a lot of uses, for example, if I have a link that I wanted to
        look better while the user is hovering I could use this effect on it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here is an example below: <br />
        <br />
        <a href="#" class="coolhov"> Hover me to see the underline effect! </a>
      </p>
      <br />

      <h1>Image Blending</h1>
      <p>
        In anticipation of having images on my website for the first project I
        took some time out to learn how I could make them look better. <br />
        One of the tricks I learned was how to blend images together to make
        them looker better than they would without having been blended. <br />
        <br> Here is an example of how it looks: <br> 
        <div class="pics">
            <div class="pic1"></div>
            <div class="pic2"></div>
            <div class="pic3"></div>
        </div>
      </p>
    </div>
