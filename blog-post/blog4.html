      <h1>Making a Shapes with CSS</h1>
      <p>
        I was learning a lot about things I can do with HTML and CSS together,
        but this week I wanted to learn something that I can make with only CSS.
        I decided to learn how to make different shapes because there are a lot
        of applications for making shapes to make a website look better. <br />
        <br />
        Below is an example of making a circle with only CSS:
      </p>
      <div id="shapes">
        <div class="circle"></div>
        <div class="tri"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
      <h1>Rotating Image/Shape</h1>
      <p>
        I was wondering how I could make a loading screen for a website with a
        spinning image that shows that the page is loading. <br />
        So to do this I learned about CSS animations to effectively do it.
        <br />
        I believe this will make my first project website look a lot more
        professional if I have a nice loading animation avaliable to use.

        alt="Loading Image"
        id="spinner"
      />
