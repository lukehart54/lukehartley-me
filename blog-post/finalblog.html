      <p>
        This has by far been my favorite class I have taken at JMU. You are an
        awesome professor Dr. Stewart!
      </p>

        I think the this class is already very well structured and the
        information all being easily accessible online in an ordered way helped
        me tremendously.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to design the class there are only a few things I would
        change. One being a few more examples of what we learn in class, I find
        it very helpful when I can see the general idea of how I need to solve a
        problem or do a lab. I don't mean to give an identical example, but
        being able to see how small parts of the lab/projects should be working
        would be nice.
      </p>

        Like I said the online "textbook" is the thing I used the most
        throughout the semester, but I would also look things up on youtube or
        stackoverflow if I needed extra help understanding something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall this class is already very well taught and would be fine
        regardless of implementing my suggestions or not. Thanks for a great semester!
